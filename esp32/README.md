# ESP32 Streamer
This code is just a sample you need to adapt it to your setup. 
It's not perfect you can improve much at this code but it shows how to make a MVP to stream images.

*For example*
- Change pins to your wiring
- Check wlan hostname password
- Change target host that points to the pc that runs the java part
